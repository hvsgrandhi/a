# RingAlgorithm.java - Line by Line Explanation

```java
// RingAlgorithm.java
import java.util.*;
```
- Imports all classes from the `java.util` package, which includes collections (ArrayList, List) and utility classes (Scanner, Collections).

```java
public class RingAlgorithm {
    private List<Integer> ring;
    private Integer coordinator;
```
- Defines a class named `RingAlgorithm` with two private instance variables:
  - `ring`: A List of Integer objects representing the process IDs arranged in a logical ring
  - `coordinator`: An Integer representing the ID of the current coordinator process

```java
    public RingAlgorithm(List<Integer> processes) {
        this.ring = new ArrayList<>(processes);
        Collections.sort(this.ring);
        this.coordinator = Collections.max(ring);
    }
```
- Constructor that initializes the class with a list of process IDs
- Creates a new ArrayList containing all elements from the input list (defensive copying)
- Sorts the processes in ascending order to establish the logical ring structure
- Sets the coordinator to the process with the highest ID using `Collections.max()`

```java
    public void displayCoordinator() {
        if (coordinator != null)
            System.out.println("Current Coordinator: Process " + coordinator);
        else
            System.out.println("No coordinator currently.");
    }
```
- Method to display the current coordinator
- Checks if a coordinator exists (not null) and prints appropriate message

```java
    public void failCoordinator() {
        System.out.println("\nProcess " + coordinator + " (Coordinator) has failed.");
        ring.remove(coordinator);
        coordinator = null;
    }
```
- Method to simulate the failure of the current coordinator
- Prints a message indicating coordinator failure
- Removes the coordinator from the list of active processes in the ring
- Sets the coordinator reference to null

```java
    public void startElection(int initiator) {
        System.out.println("\nProcess " + initiator + " starts election.");
        List<Integer> activeList = new ArrayList<>();
        int index = ring.indexOf(initiator);
        int current = index;
```
- Method to start an election, taking the initiator process ID as parameter
- Prints message indicating which process started the election
- Creates an empty ArrayList `activeList` to collect IDs of active processes
- Finds the index of the initiator in the ring
- Sets the current index to the initiator's index

```java
        do {
            int next = (current + 1) % ring.size();
            int from = ring.get(current);
            int to = ring.get(next);
            System.out.println("Election message passed from Process " + from + " to Process " + to);
            activeList.add(to);
            current = next;
        } while (ring.get(current) != initiator);
```
- Begins a do-while loop to traverse the ring:
  - Calculates the index of the next process in the ring (wrapping around using modulo)
  - Gets the IDs of the current and next processes
  - Prints message showing election message passing from current to next
  - Adds the next process ID to the activeList
  - Updates current index to the next index
  - Continues until we reach the initiator again (completed full circle)

```java
        activeList.add(initiator);
        int newCoordinator = Collections.max(activeList);
        coordinator = newCoordinator;
```
- Adds the initiator process ID to the activeList
- Determines the new coordinator as the process with the highest ID in the activeList
- Updates the coordinator field with the new coordinator ID

```java
        System.out.println("Active List: " + activeList);
        System.out.println("Process " + newCoordinator + " becomes the new coordinator.");
    }
```
- Prints the list of active processes collected during the election
- Prints message indicating which process becomes the new coordinator

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter process IDs (space-separated): ");
        String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");
        List<Integer> processes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String s : input) processes.add(Integer.parseInt(s));
```
- Main method as entry point for the program
- Creates a Scanner to read user input
- Prompts user to enter process IDs as space-separated values
- Splits input string into an array of strings
- Creates an ArrayList of Integers, parsing each input string to an Integer

```java
        RingAlgorithm ring = new RingAlgorithm(processes);
        ring.displayCoordinator();
```
- Creates an instance of RingAlgorithm with the list of process IDs
- Calls displayCoordinator() to show the initial coordinator

```java
        ring.failCoordinator();
```
- Simulates the failure of the current coordinator

```java
        System.out.print("Enter the ID of the initiator process: ");
        int initiator = scanner.nextInt();
        if (!ring.ring.contains(initiator)) {
            System.out.println("Invalid initiator process.");
            return;
        }
```
- Prompts user to enter the ID of the process that will initiate the election
- Reads the initiator ID
- Validates that the initiator process exists in the list of active processes
- If invalid, prints error message and exits

```java
        ring.startElection(initiator);
    }
}
```
- Starts the election with the specified initiator
- Closes the class definition
